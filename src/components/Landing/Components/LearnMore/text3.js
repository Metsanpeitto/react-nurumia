        With our vision on how we should deal with food production and the
        growing world population, we want to do our bit to create a better
        world. Urbanization, soil pollution, energy waste, lack of clean
        (drinking) water: if we do nothing about these things, we will be
        destroying our own future. And that of the future generation. But if we
        handle our natural resources in a smarter way, there will be enough for
        everyone, without us exhausting Mother Earth. And that is what drives
        us.
