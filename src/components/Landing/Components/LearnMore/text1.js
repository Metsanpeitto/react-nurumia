        In the next 30 years, every 3 months a city with more than 9 million
        inhabitants will arise in a lower delta. Inhabitants of these cities
        will often live in poor circumstances or in expensive small apartments,
        breathing smog and smelling sewage.<br></br> The urgent need for a
        living and working environment with clean air, clean energy, drinkable
        water, smart mobility and safe and healthy food is increasingly felt by
        the leaders and inhabitants of these rapidly growing metropolitan areas.
        More and more city governments, city planners and real estate developers
        start to realize that they can only continue to expand their city if the
        surrounding areas (the green belt or urban growth boundary) and their
        food production will be included as an integral part of these major
        urban developments. This integral approach is needed to help solve many
        problems related to living, mobility, energy, water and food and will
        enhance social coherence, create new jobs and business opportunities.{" "}

        Priva wants to help these cities transform by creating a climate for
        growth. By developing leading edge technology, services and knowledge
        for climate control and process automation in horticulture, the built
        environment and anything in between. We contribute to a climate that
        offers a sustainable living for a growing and urbanizing world
        population.
