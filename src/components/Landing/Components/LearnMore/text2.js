        It is our mission to contribute to a sustainable world where a growing
        world population can live a healthy and comfortable life. <br></br>With
        our unique combination of hardware, software and services we are
        perfectly positioned to offer solutions for the challenges the
        urbanizing world faces.<br></br> Whatever we do, our focus is on local
        and efficient food production, green and clean buildings and
        neighborhoods and minimal use of scarce natural resources like fossil
        energy and fresh water. This way, we believe that we can really
        contribute to a number of themes that are high on the global political
        agenda: water, food, climate and energy.
